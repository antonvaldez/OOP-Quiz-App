# OOP Quiz App 🧠

A simple command-line quiz app built with Python to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and encapsulation.

## 🗂️ Files

- `main.py` - The entry point of the app
- `question_model.py` - The `Question` class definition
- `quiz_brain.py` - The `QuizBrain` class that controls quiz logic
- `data.py` - Holds sample question data (easily replaceable with database queries)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Answer with True or False when prompted.

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Looping through data
- Input validation
- Simple quiz game logic

## 🧪 Future Improvements
- Add a GUI (e.g., with Tkinter or PyQt)
- Pull questions from an actual API or database
- Add difficulty filtering
